# MySmartContractProject

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple Solidity smart contract using Hardhat. The contract allows setting and retrieving a stored value.

## Project Vision

To provide a foundational example for developers looking to deploy smart contracts on the Core Testnet 2.

## Key Features

- Deploy a smart contract with an initial value.
- Set and get the stored value.

## Future Scope

- Implement additional functions for contract interaction.
- Deploy to other testnets and mainnets.
## Things you need to do:

- Project.sol file - Rename this file and add the solidity code inside it.
- deploy.js file - Add the deploy.js (javascript) code inside it.
- .env.example - Add the Private Key of your MetaMask Wallet's account.
- Readme.md file - Add the Readme content inside this file.
- package.json file â€“ Replace the `"name"` property value from `"Project-Title"` to your actual project title. <br/>
*Example:* `"name": "crowdfunding-smartcontract"`
